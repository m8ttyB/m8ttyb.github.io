<a class=heading-link href=#boulder-qa-meetup---discussion-on-cd><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>I recently visited with a group of software testers up in Boulder, Colorado to
discuss peoples thought&rsquo;s and feeling&rsquo;s about Continuous Delivery. The trip
highlighted that this conversation still covers unfamiliar ground among software
developers and testers alike.</p><p>As a few of you are likely to acknowledge I have strong opinions on this subject.
I purposely left my opinions at home, I wanted to observe the natural progression
of the conversation among the group.</p><p>Open questions that the group identified:</p><ul><li>What tools/concepts/workflows exist that help projects move faster but ensure there isn&rsquo;t a loss of product quality.</li><li>Confusion about QA’s roles - with dev/ops fiercely in the limelight, what value and place does QA have on a project [specifically Manual testing].</li><li>Will product quality degrade over time — how do we recognize if a loss of polish is occurring on projects.</li></ul><p>The <a href=http://secretmustache.com/2014/10/continuous-delivery-discussion.html>generic workflow</a> makes sense to people from a hypothetical point of view,
yet when they attempt to apply it to their work the conversation quickly stalls.
I think in part because the mental leaps away from our comfort zone; both with
letting go of perceived control and our old mental model of our roles on projects.</p><p>A big ake away from the Meetup was that it&rsquo;s important to release ourselves from the percieved constraints of our job roles.
The software development lifecyles is a forever evolving conversation and test engineering organziations are in a unique
position to drive these conversations. Continuous delivery and continous deployment are mechanizms that test engineers can
use to drive quality on increasingly complex products.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
