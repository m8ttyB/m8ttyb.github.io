All of my itches were being scratched.</p><p>A few years ago I wanted to start writing again but discovered a problem. The version my static site generator (<a href=https://blog.getpelican.com/>Pelican</a>) was pinned to was vastly outdated. I also had enough custom code that porting it to a more recent release felt overwhelming.</p><p>I’ve gnashed my teeth for years and let my site sit unused.</p><h2 id=overcoming-entropy>Overcoming Entropy
<a class=heading-link href=#overcoming-entropy><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>The wind was blowing, and the world in our small valley was cloaked in dust. Last week I decided to port my blog to a new platform. I poked around a few options, including building and hosting a <a href=https://ghost.org/>Ghost</a> instance, which I discarded because I wanted simple.</p><p>I landed on <a href=https://ghost.org/>Hugo</a>, the reasons being:</p><ul><li>Dead simple static site generator, active project.</li><li>Markdown, which I use day in and day out.</li><li>Hostable on github.io, with <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages>custom domain names</a></li><li><a href=https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action>Git Actions</a> - Ability to move site generation to a simple CI/CD workflow.</li></ul><h1 id=whats-next>What’s Next
<a class=heading-link href=#whats-next><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h1><p>The world is full of possibilities again. The past 3-years have been a fogbank, where memories feel vague. I have a delightfully energized 8-year-old with summer plans that involve several adventures.</p><p>My misadventures in tech have been a bit curious over this time, and I have a lot that I’d like to share.
I’m looking forward to stretching my mind and doing more writing.</p><h2 class=date>~ May 23, 2022</h2></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
