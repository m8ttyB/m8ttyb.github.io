<meta name=keywords content="writing,life"><meta name=description content="A New Beginning
A couple of years ago - in 2016, I think - I stopped writing for various reasons. A significant one being I became a parent and found that I enjoyed devoting all of my free time to endless child-driven adventures.
I also worked in Open Source, actively contributing to projects, and engaged with a globally distributed community.
All of my itches were being scratched.
A few years ago I wanted to start writing again but discovered a problem. The version my static site generator (Pelican) was pinned to was vastly outdated. I also had enough custom code that porting it to a more recent release felt overwhelming."><meta name=author content="Matt Brandt"><link rel=canonical href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/blog/2022/writing_again/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://m8ttyb.github.io/blog/2022/writing_again/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://m8ttyb.github.io/blog/2022/writing_again/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="SecretMustache"><meta property="og:title" content="Writing Again"><meta property="og:description" content="A New Beginning A couple of years ago - in 2016, I think - I stopped writing for various reasons.
