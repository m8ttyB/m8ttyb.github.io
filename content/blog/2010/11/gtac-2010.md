I just returned from a great trip to Hyderabad, India for this year's
Google Test Automation Conference. An inspiring trip where I spent
several days getting test-geek on with a room full of other very
passionate testers.

It will be interesting wot where I can apply the tools and methodologies that I
learned about at the conference to the print-workflow industry. 

More joyously, I'm looking forward to the collaboration opportunities with my new cross-continent contacts.
