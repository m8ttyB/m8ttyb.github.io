I thought this would be an interesting share, this hasn't happened to
me before. A few days ago I received a recruitment email from a local
recruiter who found me on LinkedIn. I figured it couldn't hurt to see
where the exchange might lead. I'm always curious to learn what's
happening in other parts of our industry. I've learned that often times
you can distinguish what values are implicitly expressed and valued by
an interviewers questions. You can also learn a lot by what is not asked
in an interview.

_Dear [Insert Recruiter Name]_,

Here are the responses that you requested. I realized while answering
the questions that there is perhaps a significant difference between the 
Professional Services groupat IBM and your group. Our organization is
fairly flat when it comes to our Professional Services QA team. There
are no test leads per say, we act as a collective body who critique each
other. As a generalization each person on the team tends to specialize
in areas of the product. I was brought onto the team to focus on
automation and push the team towards best practices.

> But what does a test plan at IBM consist of?

The short answer is the level of granularity in a test plan 
varies depending on the specific project, the amount of risk
introduced into the system by the changes, the module being tested, and
time constraints. Often times these begin as broad-stroked outlines of
tests that we aggregate into test suites. Due to the nature of our
interpretation of the agile process a story's implementation often
evolves throughout the sprint. It is up to the tester to work closely
with the developers, customer, product owner, and system architect to
understand and guide the test planÂ appropriately. I should note that I
believe it falls on the tester to play the role of understanding the
largest picture of the system that is being developed for and helping
the team keep that picture freshly oriented during the different
development phases.

> Were they created by him alone or as an assist?

I create test cases and plans on a regular basis. The initial test plan
is formed when we're discussing a story's acceptance criteria during
planning. When the iteration begins, it is the responsibility of each
tester on our teams to take ownership of drafting the initial test plans
for the story that they've picked from the task list. These test plans
are fluid tours of what needs to be tested. When I say that the test
plan is the responsibility of the individual, what it really means is
that they are responsible for engaging other team members in the
process. Quality is owned by the team, the role of the tester is that of
an advocate.

> Where did he learn testing methodology? Who was his mentor and/or basis for his skills?

I learned the basics of test design in school and supplemented that
experience with experimentation while managing development teams and
projects at my company, Freecog. Now that I am aligned with IBM, I
continue to study process and test theory and experiment with practices
that may be relevant to our workflows. There is also a lot of discussion
amongst the team about best practices. 

As for direct mentoring there is a development lead and senior architect 
who share interests with me and provide a forum for discussion and direction 
(the first individual in automation, the second in better test design for 
our product). I am also an active member in the agile test community and 
find great inspiration from the people that I interact with.
