Not so long ago I would have cringed a lot harder than I am right now at
the thought of buying an eReader. I adore books, I love the smell, the
feel, and the way they look decorating my book shelves. I'm also one of
those offensive people who will write in the margins of my books...
especially technical or science/math books. I will be that offensive
person you see in the coffee shop marring his books with a pen.

So what the heck am I doing with one of these little (mostly) single use
devices?! Well aside from the fact that it is wicked nice to have the
next book in a series that you're reading available at your fingertips
(and for less $$$ than a physical copy) or the nicety of having an easy
one device carry-all for all the various digital programming reference
material that I have; these little turkeys run Java on Linux. Access to
the kdk, the cute name that I suspect the Kindle team came up with for
their sdk is currently in a non-open beta. I'm currently in the waiting
room to see if I'm found worthy to access to it.

In the long term I'm hoping to fiddle with the device and create a few
reading/teaching apps for my 6 yr/old niece. My mother-in-law is a
teacher and has been wanting something with these capabilities for years
as a teaching and reading aid for students whose parents don't read to
them. I think this could be a fun project purely from an academic point
of view of exploring the devices capabilities.

The coming eReader wars are upon us.  It will be awesome
to see what prevails in the coming year with touch screens, Android
based tablets, and even the locked down iPad.
