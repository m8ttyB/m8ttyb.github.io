I am having a quiet evening tonight shuffling through imagery and
thoughts of my past and wondering what is next. I didn't sit down
tonight with the intent to write this. It just felt right. This
post is for me. Finally.

A lot of time has passed since I've felt the healthy untethering of my
thoughts and a full awakening of a past spirit that was a constant
flame in my life. A lot of personal healing and strength over the
years is culminating and reveling itself in these next steps of my
life.

The story is old and I was younger.

Years past, more than 15 of them. I saw
lot's of suffering and joy in the world; worked in 3rd world health clinics,
worked with displaced children living on the streets, organized and
led service learning abroad trips to Latin America. I spent time as a
backcountry ranger for the Forest Service. I traveled for 2 years
and lived out of a backpack with the simple intent of experiencing
the world and it's humanity. I was enthusiastic, a dreamer, and high
spirited. I lived a fully present life and because of that the world
opened to me.

I saw hope and prosperity in the most unbelievable places and
moments.

I followed an education and career into human services. I chose
Psychology and had the desire of doing graduate work in developmental
cognitive neuroscience. That all changed. Only a few close friends and family
members followed me through the fire or remember me from before.

At the time - 8 years ago - I had made my home in an isolated corner
of Southwestern Colorado working as a councilor at a juvenile detention
facility. I worked with children who were barely hanging on as the
system and often their own families eroded their hope for a future.
I tried to make a difference.

One evening I watched my supervisor hurt a child and reported him to
our superiors. I was later terminated because I wouldn't change a
report I had written about the incident. I wouldn't remove a statement
the child had made, he had fingered the supervisor as an abuser.
Once the State found out about the incident the agency tried to protect
itself through subterfuge and reported that I had failed to report the
abuse to them. I became unemployable, because of the circumstances I would
couldn't work with children again. I couldn't attend the graduate program
that I had applied to. I was destroyed.

I took menial jobs and sold most of my worldly possessions so my
partner and I could pay rent and purchase food. I sold items and let
go of dreams that were my identity. I fought and struggled to return
to the work that I wanted to do, to work with children. After more than
5 years of dealing with lawyers and the despair of the court system
I failed, I gave up and pursued a new career.

I've been whole for sometime but it wasn't until tonight that it fully dawned
on me.

I am exploring the world again and relishing in it's warmth. I have more
miles on my body but I emerged. I am doing work that is worthwhile and
of consequence. I am of consequence and am helping make the world better.
