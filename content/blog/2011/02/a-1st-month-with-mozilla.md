Of the adventures and life events that I've had the fortune
to be a part of and experience this latest one is without a doubt
turning out amazing. Daily I am stunned by the diverse passions and
skills of the community of people who encompass Mozilla, not to mention
the excellent projects that I’m on (oh... and the free coffee). The coffee
bit is a novelty to me at previous employers the staff have had to pool
their money together to buy items like a coffee pot and a fridge (for our lunches).

I’m transitioning in as the test engineering lead on the [Input](http://input.mozilla.com/) and [Socorro](https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/)
projects. These projects are built around the simple notion of
aggregating, setting free, and making information useful.

The [Input project](http://input.mozilla.com/) aggregates user submitted feedback from Firefox.
[Socorro](https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/) is a collection pot for information gathered when Firefox,
Thunderbird, **etc** crash.

Feel free to wet your appetite by poking around these projects.
