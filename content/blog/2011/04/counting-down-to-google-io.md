I'm incredibly excited for this year's [Google I/O](https://io.google/).
We're just **10 days** away from it's commencement and I have word from
my close [friend](http://readmythings.com/) that he's booked our hotel room. We've compared
notes, vetted the list of [sessions](http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions_schedule.html)
we want to attend, and are excited to meet the worldly gaggle of like willed 
people who attend this event.

On the short list are the **mobile development** sessions and the
**tech talk series**. This coming 6-months should prove quite frantic
with the number of devices coming to market and the stage is set for a
lot of innovation.

At this years event I'm interested in meeting with other **test minded**
developers to discuss the current *cutting edge* in testing applications
on Android devices. I'll mention ahead of time that I consider everyone
involved in the software process a *developer* whether you're someone
who tests code, writes documentation, are a project manager, or simply
write code. **Drop me an email** if you're interested in chatting!
