As part of Mozilla's continuing QA tech talk series
I'd like to invite you to [Shmuel Gerhon's](http://testing.gershon.info) presentation
on exploratorytesting. The author of [Rapid Reporter](http://testing.gershon.info/reporter/)
and a QA technical lead at Intel's Jerusalem Campus, he is convinced that the most significant
factor in our quest for quality is people, not features or technology.
That a whole team approach is a necessity when advocating for a quality
product.
