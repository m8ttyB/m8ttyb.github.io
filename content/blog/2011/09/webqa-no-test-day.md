Hello all,

A late update for tomorrows WebQA hosted test day, Friday 2011-09-09.

WebQA won't be hosting a test day this week. I had planned on a day of working
to expand the Selenium coverage on [Socorro](https://crash-stats.allizom.org) 
(aka Breakpad ... akaCrashstats).Â  Of the many reasons I can think of it 
mainly comes down to I've been overrun with work and can't sustainably host 
this tomorrow. This is not to say that the backlog of tests to be automated is small,
in fact with the help of [Tobias Markus](https://twitter.com/#!/tobbi_) 
(our wonderful intern) it has ceaselessly grown as he's dug through the
existing testcases during hisgap analysis.

I'm absolutely encouraged by the amount of interesting testcases that
could use automation and look forward to having a formal testing day
arranged for this project soon.
