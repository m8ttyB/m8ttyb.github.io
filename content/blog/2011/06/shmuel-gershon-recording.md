Last month as part of Mozilla's QA tech talk series Shmuel spoke about
exploratory testing and in particular an open source tool that he
authored. I apologize for the delay however I'm happy to have a link to
the *ogg* video for those of you who couldn't be present for the live
viewing.

Enjoy and feel free to ping me or Shmuel with questions.
