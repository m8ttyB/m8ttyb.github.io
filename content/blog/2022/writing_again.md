## A New Beginning 
A couple of years ago - in 2016, I think - I stopped writing for various reasons. A significant one being I became a parent and found that I enjoyed devoting all of my free time to endless child-driven adventures. 

I also worked in Open Source, actively contributing to projects, and engaged with a globally distributed community. 
All of my itches were being scratched.

A few years ago I wanted to start writing again but discovered a problem. The version my static site generator ([Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/)) was pinned to was vastly outdated. I also had enough custom code that porting it to a more recent release felt overwhelming.

I’ve gnashed my teeth for years and let my site sit unused.

## Overcoming Entropy
The wind was blowing, and the world in our small valley was cloaked in dust. Last week I decided to port my blog to a new platform. I poked around a few options, including building and hosting a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) instance, which I discarded because I wanted simple.

I landed on [Hugo](https://ghost.org/), the reasons being:
* Dead simple static site generator, active project.
* Markdown, which I use day in and day out.
* Hostable on github.io, with [custom domain names](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)
* [Git Actions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action) - Ability to move site generation to a simple CI/CD workflow.

# What’s Next
The world is full of possibilities again. The past 3-years have been a fogbank, where memories feel vague. I have a delightfully energized 8-year-old with summer plans that involve several adventures.

My misadventures in tech have been a bit curious over this time, and I have a lot that I’d like to share.
I’m looking forward to stretching my mind and doing more writing.
