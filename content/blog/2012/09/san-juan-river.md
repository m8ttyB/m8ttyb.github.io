We're tired but feeling content after a great out-and-back trip to the sunny
and remote South West. [Erin](http://www.sexinyourear.com/), [tallowen](https://twitter.com/tallowen) and I drove from Mountain View, CA
to Durango, CO. Roughly ~1,000 miles to meet with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chris_mcmahon) before Owen and I spent 6 lazily days floating down the lower [San Juan river](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_River_%28Colorado_River%29).

While Owen and I were out on the river Erin visited family and got to hangout with
our new nephew Colt.

All told we floated ~60 miles; putting in at [Mexican Hat](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=mexican+hat+utah&hnear=Mexican+Hat,+San+Juan,+Utah&t=h&z=12) and taking out at
[Clay Hills](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Clay+Hills,+San+Juan,+Utah&hl=en&sll=37.151946,-109.867066&sspn=0.193191,0.362206&oq=clay+hills+utah&t=h&hnear=Clay+Hills&z=11). The flow-rate was fairly low and the temperatures were quite high
but this helped keep the river really quiet. If I remember correctly we saw only
one other group for the entirety of the trip.

I've always felt that river trips are better than regular camping... lot's of
gourmet food, cold micro-brews (courtesy of [Ska](http://www.skabrewing.com/main.html)), and most importantly
access to remote and nearly inaccessible places that very few people get trod on.

Great times, I'm looking forward to our next trip. tallowen has really become my
partner of choice for exploring remote and difficult to reach places.

Cheers to our next adventure.
