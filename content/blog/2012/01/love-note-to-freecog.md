This isn't actually a eulogy .. I just wanted to show [Alex](http://twitter.com/#!/lakatos88) some
visuals on the hardware that is running freecog.com. I've run my primary
site from this little beast for years (previously on a PII box running
FreeBSD).  It wasn't a problem until I started working at Mozilla. I now
get enough page hits that the lights dim at my apartment and the special
lady friend, my partner, complains that the Internet noticeably slows. 
This happens whenever I submit a post and more than a handful of people
decide to read it.

I'm keeping the box and
domain for dev/play purposes (no you can't have the domain name ...
unless you want to swap something fun for it ... I do like good beer
from foreign countries or chew toys for my cat). I originally snagged
the domain when I was a Psychology geek, Freecog == free cognition. I
had the lofty goal of blogging about cognitive neuroscience.  At least
for for the time being life has spun me into the domain of computer
science. Specs:

-  [Asus Eee PC 1000H](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC)
