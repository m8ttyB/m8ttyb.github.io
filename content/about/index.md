I'm a desert rat and dreamer who frequently escapes into the world for dad-like adventures. Professionally I am Software Engineer but prefer to spend time afk when possible.

![Me](/about/me.jpeg)

Most recently I've joined a small band of misfits at Geospan. I'm staff engineer and technical lead.

I have a rich past working in Open Source; as a project maintainer and core contributor with IBM and Mozilla. The two and a half years between Mozilla and Planet were spent exploring Reliability Engineering. Now, with Geospan, I'm a generalist DevOps engineer.
