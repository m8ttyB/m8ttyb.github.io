Considered a desert rat and dreamer who frequently escapes into the world for dad-like adventures. Professionally I am Software Engineer, Program Manager, and Engineering Manager.

![Me](/about/me.jpeg)

As part of a professional growth arc, Iâ€™ve moved into Reliability Engineering to understand the roles, impact, and how this domain elevates an engineering organization.
I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer for Firstup, working on EKS deployed microservices that service millions of requests per day. I have a rich past working in Open Source; as a project maintainer and core contributor with IBM and Mozilla.
Moments have filled me with joh:
* Firefox Interoperability Engineering Manager and the adventures therein.
* Selenium project, Python bindings contributor.
* Community manager and evangelist; maintained communities in North and South America, Canada, and Europe. Forever indebted to the Romanian and South African OSS communities <3
* Brought interns onto our teams using outreachy.org as a vehicle to elevate those impacted by systemic bias and underrepresentation.
* SIGAccess, created pathways to progress leading edge Accessibility research, moving work into open source tools for UX and developer teams.
* Partnering with and creating OSS curricula and teaching engagements with universities.
