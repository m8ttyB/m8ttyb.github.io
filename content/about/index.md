Considered a desert rat and dreamer who frequently escapes into the world for dad-like adventures. Professionally I am Software Engineer, Program Manager, and Engineering Manager.

![Me](/about/me.jpeg)

As part of a professional growth arc, I've moved into Reliability Engineering to better understand the roles, impact, and how this domain elevates an engineering organization.

I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer for Firstup, following a battery included approach to improving observability for EKS deployed microservices that serve millions of users a day.

I have a rich past working in Open Source; as a project maintainer and core contributor with IBM and Mozilla. 

Moments that made me proud:
* Firefox Interoperability Engineering Manger.
* Selenium project, Python bindings contributor.
* Community manager and evangelist; maintained communities in North and South America, Canada, and Europe.
  * Forever indebted to the Romanian and South African OSS communities <3
* Brought interns on our teams using [outreachy.org](https://www.outreachy.org/) as vehicle to elevate those impacted by systemic bias and undrepresentation.
* SIGAccess, created pathways to progress leading edge Accessibility research, moving work into open source tools for UX and developer teams.
* Partnering with and creating OSS curriculia and teaching engagements with universities.
