Considered a desert rat and dreamer who frequently escapes into the world for dad-like adventures. Professionally I am Software Engineer, Program Manager, and Engineering Manager.

As part of a professional growth arc, I've moved into Reliability Engineering to better understand the roles, impact, and how this domain elevates an engineering organization.

I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer for Firstup, following a battery included approach to improving observability for EKS deployed microservices that serve millions of users a day.

I have a rich past working in Open Source; as a project maintainer and core contributor for IBM and Mozilla.
* Firefox Interoperability Engineering Manger
* Selenium project, Python bindings contributor
* Community manager and evangelist; maintained communities in North and South America, Canada, and Europe. 
* SIGAccess, created pathways to progress leading edge Accessibility research, moving work into open source tools for UX and developer teams.
