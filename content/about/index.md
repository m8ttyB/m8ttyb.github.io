Considered by some a desert rat and dreamer who frequently escapes into the world for dad-like adventures. Professionally I am Software Engineer.

![Me](/about/me.jpeg)

I recently joined [Planet Labs](https://planet.com/), where the group has carved out a new role within the Platform Operations team - Operational Readiness Engineering.

I have a rich past working in Open Source; as a project maintainer and core contributor with IBM and Mozilla. The two and a half years between Mozilla and Planet were spent exploring Reliability Engineering.

Interesting professional moments:

* Shifting from IC roles with a Test Engineering orientation to Site Reliability and Operational Readiness.
* Firefox Interoperability Engineering Manager and the adventures therein.
* Selenium project contributor, Python bindings.
* Community manager and evangelist; maintained communities in North and South America, Canada, and Europe.
  * Forever indebted to the Romanian and South African OSS communities <3
* Brought interns onto our teams using [outreachy.org](https://www.outreachy.org/) as a vehicle to elevate those impacted by systemic bias and underrepresentation.
* SIGAccess, created pathways to progress leading edge Accessibility research, moving work into open source tools for UX and developer teams.
* Partnering with and creating OSS curricula and teaching engagements with universities.
