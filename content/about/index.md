I'm a desert rat and dreamer who frequently escapes into the world for dad-like adventures. Professionally I am Software Engineer but prefer to spend time afk when possible.

![Me](/about/me.jpeg)

Most recently I've joined a small band of misfits at Geospan. I'm a Staff DevOps Engineer and technical lead focused on supporting a team of engineers.

I have a rich past working in Open Source; as a project maintainer and core contributor with IBM and Mozilla. After leaving Mozilla I went back into the proverbial trenches as a beginner, 
honing my DevOps skills. A highlight of this time in the wilderness was when I emerged and joined Planet Labs.

I'll see you on the slopes (skiing) or in some remote canyon deep in the wilderness.
