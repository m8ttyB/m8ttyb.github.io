      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-beginning&#34;&gt;A New Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago - in 2016, I think - I stopped writing for various reasons. A significant one being I became a parent and found that I enjoyed devoting all of my free time to endless child-driven adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked in Open Source, actively contributing to projects, and engaged with a globally distributed community.
All of my itches were being scratched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wanted to start writing again but discovered a problem. The version my static site generator (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;) was pinned to was vastly outdated. I also had enough custom code that porting it to a more recent release felt overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
